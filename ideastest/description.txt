[h1][b]Information[/b][/h1]
This mod brings ideas and policies from [i]Europa Universalis IV[/i] to [i]Hearts of Iron IV[/i].

[h1][b]Features[/b][/h1]
This mod adds 27 idea groups with 7 ideas each as well as 64 policies that you can buy in exchange for Political Power.

The idea groups are split into 3 categories:
[list]
[*] [b]Administrative:[/b] Administrative Ideas, Economic Ideas, Innovativeness Ideas, Communist Ideas, Democratic Ideas, Fascist Ideas, Monarchist Ideas, Minister Ideas, Internal Policy Ideas
[*] [b]Diplomatic:[/b] Trade Ideas, Diplomatic Ideas, Intervention Ideas, Influence Ideas, Capital Ship Ideas, Submarine Ideas, Carrier Ideas, Espionage Ideas, Resistance Ideas
[*] [b]Military:[/b] Leadership Ideas, Quality Ideas, Quantity Ideas, Offensive Ideas, Defensive Ideas, Air Combat Ideas, Tank Ideas, Bombing Ideas, Occupation Ideas
[/list]

Each idea group has at least 5 policies that require the idea group itself as well as another idea group to be fully unlocked.

All countries have 8 idea group slots which are unlocked by date, one per year. A game rule allows to extend it from being able to take 8 idea groups up to 26, the additional ones are as well unlocked yearly. An idea group can be chosen for each slot allowing to unlock its ideas and thus gaining their specific bonuses.
Furthermore, countries have 7 national ideas, 2 traditions and 1 ambition, which are unlocked by completing ideas. To unlock all national ideas and thus gaining the ambition, at least 21 ideas have to be unlocked.

Currently there are 31 unique national idea sets included as well as a generic one.
[i]If you are able to adopt a new national idea set (e.g. Imperial German Ideas), you can switch to them by using a decision.[/i]
